TASK-4 FOR PRODIGY INFOTECH DATA SCIENCE INERNSHIP
Sentiment Analysis and Visualization of Social Media Data

Social media platforms are rich sources of public opinion and sentiment. By analyzing this data, we can understand the general sentiment towards specific topics or brands. This project involves collecting social media data, preprocessing it, performing sentiment analysis, and visualizing the results to identify trends and patterns.

Data Collection
The data for this project is collected from social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram using APIs. We focus on posts, comments, and other relevant interactions that mention the topics or brands of interest.

Data Preprocessing
Before analyzing the data, we preprocess it to ensure accuracy and consistency. The preprocessing steps include:

Removing duplicates, Handling missing values, Tokenization, Removing stop words, Lemmatization and stemming.

Sentiment Analysis
We use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to perform sentiment analysis on the preprocessed data. The steps involved are:

Text vectorization using techniques such as TF-IDF or word embeddings. Training sentiment classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, LSTM). Classifying the sentiment of each post (e.g., positive, negative, neutral).

Data Visualization
To visualize the sentiment patterns, we create various plots and charts, such as:

Time series plots showing sentiment trends over time, Word clouds highlighting frequently mentioned terms in positive, negative, and neutral posts, Sentiment distribution plots, Geographical sentiment maps (if location data is available).
